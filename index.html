					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>On May 4, 1961, the Freedom Riders departed in buses from Washington D.C toward New Orleans, Louisiana. The Freedom Riders were a group of civil rights activists that wanted to challenge segregation laws in the south. Throughout their journey, they would encounter resistance, break laws, face arrest and occasionally get injured during mob breakouts and reactions. The goal pursued by the Freedom Riders was to desegregate buses, bus terminals and the accommodations in the terminals (76).</p>

				<div id="howTheyStarted">
					<h3>How They Started</h3>
					
					<p>On April 9th, 1947, the Journey of Reconciliation took place. It would consist of eight white men and eight black men. They would take a two week pilgrimage, which was organized by the Fellowship of Reconciliation, including George Houser, James Farmer, and Bernise Fisher, on buses throughout Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky.</p>

					<h3>Participants</h3>
					
					<p>Freedom Riders were civil rights activists who were outraged by laws that did not give African-Americans rights that a non-colored man would have. Many of these activists rode buses down into the deep south to experience the racism firsthand, and to see whether or not anti-segregation laws were truly being recognized as they were in the north (57).</p>
					<blockquote>
					  <p>"The purpose of the Freedom Rides was to test the enforcement of a pair of Supreme Court rulings striking down the constitutionality of segregated seating on interstate (crossing state lines) buses and trains, as well as segregation in the terminal waiting rooms, rest rooms, and restaurants."</p>
					  <cite>Phillis Engelbert</cite>

					<h3>Reactions</h3>
					
					<p>The Freedom Riders encountered much opposition from the public during their journey. The first Freedom Ride encountered resistance and arrests in Virginia. They then continued on to South Carolina, where they faced even more violence, including beatings and the arrest of one rider. This violence attracted the media’s attention, and gave the freedom riders some publicity. The first freedom riders continued on to Alabama, where they were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan firebombed the buses and forced the riders into the mob, where they received no protection from the local police(94).</p>

					<h3>Federal and State Intervention</h3>
					
					<p>In response to the Freedom Riders rides, for safety and mob control, the governor of Alabama and a Department of Justice representative made arrangements for the rides to have a police escort. This was the first official intervention between the Freedom Riders and the state governments, although the escort was not completely carried out(54).
					</p>
					<blockquote>
					  <p>"Every person operating a bus line in the city shall provide equal but separate accommodations for white people and negroes on his buses, by requiring the employees in charge thereof to assign passengers seats on the vehicles under their charge in such manner as to separate the white people from the negroes where there are both white and negroes on the same car; provided, however, that negro nurses having in charge white children or sick or infirm white persons, may be assigned seats among white people.”</p>
					  <cite>Montgomery, Alabama City Code 1952</cite>
