					<h3>Project Process Paper</h3>
					<p>The theme for the National History Day Project was “Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History”; so our group wanted to choose a topic that would relate to theme, yet be unique. We brainstormed and researched topics that we found interesting and picked the Freedom Riders.<br><br>

					The process of researching more information for our topic was carried out by finding and evaluating different types of sources available to us. We used a few books and websites of both primary and secondary sources to conduct our research. For our primary sources, we used quotes from participants and others from the duration of the Freedom Riders.<br><br>

					To build our website, we decided to write our website from scratch in HTML and CSS. In order to allow all group members to work on a synchronized copy, all the code was stored in a GIT repository. This also allowed us to track who made what changes, and easily revert to a prior version if needed. We also set up our own web server that had a custom CGI script to pull the latest files from the repository and display them. After we finished our website, we transferred the design into Weebly’s editor and published the website on Weebly.<br><br>

					Our project relates to the theme of “Revolution, Reaction, Reform in History” because the civil rights activists who wanted to challenge the segregation laws wanted change to the laws. This can be seen as revolution. The “Reaction” of the Freedom Riders could be best described as the mobs and riots reacting to the challenges carried out by the Riders. The “Reformation” in this era involved the government finally changing the segregation laws and allowing buses and bus terminals to be desegregated.</p>
